Before and during this course, I’ve used AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot a lot to support my learning and programming. 
At work, AI helps me handle repetitive or boring tasks, like writing boilerplate code or automating small processes. 
For homework and class projects, I often use AI to save time on tedious tasks—formatting code, generating test cases, or exploring different solution ideas quickly.

The biggest benefits I’ve seen are efficiency and speed. 
AI lets me focus on the parts of programming and problem-solving that actually require thinking, rather than getting bogged down in repetitive work. 
But there are definitely limitations—AI isn’t good at debugging or figuring out why code is broken, so I still have to rely on my own reasoning to fix problems.

Looking ahead, I expect AI to continue being a helpful tool for both academic and professional problem-solving. 
It will speed up routine work and help me explore ideas faster, but critical thinking and careful evaluation will always be necessary to make sure the results actually work.
